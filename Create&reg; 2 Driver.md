# Create&reg; 2 Driver
Create2Driver.py is a small program for testing the most awesome Create2 robotics system.  The idea is to provide a simple command line easily run over ssh to perform basic commands.

The Create2 is a powerful robot constructed from refurbished Roomba&reg; systems from iRobot.  You can learn more about them [here](http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx).
