# Create2-Robot-Driver
A command line program for driving around an iRobot(R) Create 2 robot


This is a very simple turtle graphics style program for the iRobot create 2.  
The program is written in python (2.7) and uses serial to communicate with the robot.
I use this program on a raspberry pi that sits on top of the robot.  

I control the robot through a shell from my phone or laptop to the pi over wifi.
This make a very simple remote control robot with minimal effort.
